- Calculates percentage using a separate method
- Assigns grade based on percentage
- Checks scholarship eligibility
- Finds class topper using object comparison

## 🔹 Concepts Used
- Arrays of Objects
- Looping
- Conditional Statements
- Object Comparison
- Method Calls

# 📌 Task 02 – Bank Account Transfer System

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a banking system that:
- Stores account holder name, account number, and balance
- Allows deposit
- Allows withdrawal
- Allows transfer between accounts
- Prevents negative balance

## 🔹 Concepts Used
- Parameterized Constructor
- Object Passing as Method Parameter

# 📌 Task 03 – Hospital Patient Monitoring System

## 🎯 Objective
To:
- Store patient details (Name, Age, Temperature, Oxygen Level)
- Determine critical condition
- Assign ward based on oxygen level
- Count total critical patients using static method

## 🔹 Ward Rules
- Oxygen < 90 → ICU
- 90–95 → Emergency Ward
- >95 → General Ward

## 🔹 Concepts Used
- Constructors

- Commercial Consumers (Custom Rate)

## 🔹 Slab Rates
- 0–100 → Rs.10/unit
- 101–300 → Rs.15/unit
- Above 300 → Rs.25/unit

## 🔹 Concepts Used
- Method Overloading
- Slab Calculation Logic
- Object Creation

# 📌 Task 05 – Car Rental Management System

## 🎯 Objective
To:
- Store car model, rent per day, days rented
- Calculate total rent
- Apply discount based on rental duration
- Determine highest rental income using object comparison

## 🔹 Discount Rules
- > 7 days → 5% discount
- > 15 days → 10% discount

## 🔹 Concepts Used
- Parameterized Constructor
- Arrays of Objects
- Object Comparison
- Discount Calculation
